this is the special keyword or we can say special pointer in c++ that points to the current object  

this-> prop is same as *(this).prop

what is the need of this keyword ?
-Ans = when we have same name of arguments as well as same name of variable the computer is confused which one is what so then we use (this->var) to make it clear and identify 

and more explain the code 
this_keyword.cpp
