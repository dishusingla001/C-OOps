Inheritance = When properties & member funciton of base class are passed on the derived class

for example - 

There are two classes class a and the class b 

class b inherit the properties from class a 

and in this class a is known as the parent class 
and the class b is known as the child class and also called derived class 

--Why we use inheritance ? 
to reuse the code we use the inheritance and suppose some code is written in the class A and we want to use it in the class B so we did not need to rewrite the same code in the class B we can use the concept of inheritance
