--oops are very usefull in c++
-because as we use STL vector is use the oops as the concept in defined internally in oops classes
-and it is very usefull for the real life examples and problems 

Here we study (Classes and objects)
objects - objects are the entities in the real world 
classes - classes is like a blueprint of these entities 

real world example - 
1.In the car factory there is a blueprint of the car 
  so they can create the car like fortuner easily with the help of 
  that blue print 

  like in the blue print they define properties/attribute 
  color,design,speed,model,name;

  so they can easily create new car 

2.Suppose in the college there is a class called account for the teacher 
  In which there is a information of the teacher like 
  name,dept,subject,salary these are the properties/attributes of the class account 

  and also there is a method defined in the class and we can say the function defined 
  in the class or also known as member function

  (change dept) in which anyone from the system can change the dept easily

3.In the amazon there is a blueprint for the every product 
  in which they define the properties or attributes of the product 
  like name,price,description,discount 

  class launch new products with the help of this blueprint easily
